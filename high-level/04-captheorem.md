CAP Theorem
The CAP Theorem (also known as Brewer's Theorem) states that in any distributed data system, it is impossible to simultaneously guarantee all three of the following properties:

Consistency (C):
Every read operation receives the most recent write or an error. 

Availability (A):
Every request receives a non-error response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write. A system should always remain responsive, even if it returns stale data.

Partition Tolerance (P):
The system continues to function despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures. A partition refers to the loss of communication between parts of the system. To achieve partition tolerance, data replication across nodes is essential.

Trade-offs in Distributed Systems
According to the CAP Theorem, a distributed system can only achieve two of the above three properties at any given time. The third must be compromised. Based on the systemâ€™s design goals and use case, the trade-offs are as follows:

Consistency + Partition Tolerance (CP):
The system remains consistent and tolerant to network partitions, but availability may be sacrificed. That means some requests might not be served during network failures.

Availability + Partition Tolerance (AP):
The system stays available and resilient to partitions, but consistency may be compromised. Some nodes may return outdated or inconsistent data.

Consistency + Availability (CA):
The system ensures consistency and availability only in the absence of partitions. In real-world distributed systems, this combination is impractical because partition tolerance is typically non-negotiable.

Key Insight
In practical distributed system design, Partition Tolerance is considered a non-negotiable requirement. Therefore, the typical design decision lies between favoring Consistency or Availability, based on specific business or application needs.
